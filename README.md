# dotfiles

These are all of my configuration files for my Mac development

Make sure that iTerm2 and XCode (for homebrew) are installed, then run `bash install.sh` and set your iTerm colors to custom.itermcolors.


Note: the install.sh script may not work since I just threw it together and it does not backup your old files, so it might be better simply to use it as a reference to see what commands you'll need to run
